# 4WDC-Instafeed

It uses CSS to set the height and alignment of the instafeed class, as well as the height and width of the images it contains. It also uses media queries to adjust the height and width of the instafeed class and its images for different screen sizes.

The JavaScript code uses the $.getJSON method to retrieve an access token from the specified URL, then creates a new Instafeed object and passes in the access token and other parameters to customize its behavior. Finally, it calls the run method on the Instafeed object to start fetching and displaying images from Instagram.

Currently using Luen's paid account to request fresh IG tokens via https://www.instant-tokens.com/

If things break, you may just need to sign up for a paid account and update the token url in the code.
